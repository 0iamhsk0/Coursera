1. Data types in R:
  atomic classes(numeric, logical, character, integer, complex)
  vectors
  factors
  missing values
  data frames
  names

2. most basic object is a vector, list is a heterogenic vector

3. c() function is used to create vectors, default value = 0

4. type casting in R is called Coersion:
  of different types- implicit(automatic), explicit(manual) etc.

5. Matrix - are type of homogenous vector with a dim attribute
constructed by column wise(default)
  methods - dim, attributes, cbind, rbind, dimnames

6. factors - are ordered or unordered labeld vectors
methods - factor(c()), table, unclass, attr

7. missing values - denoted by NA or NaN
methods - is.na, is.nan

8. data frames - special lists with every element having the same length 
heterogenous type
methods - data.frame, nrow, ncol

9. Reading tabular data - 
methods - read.table, read.csv, readLines, source, dget, load, unserialize

10. write data - 
methods - write.table, writeLines, dump, dput, save, serialize
